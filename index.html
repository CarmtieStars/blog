      <h3>Tip 1. Practice With Your Friends in Creative Mode</h3>
      <p>Practicing with friends is a great and fun way to improve your skills. You could ask to 1v1 a friend or grab a group of friends and do a free for all build battle.</p>
      <p>In a free for all, it can help you in those real situations when a third party joins your battle to the death. A 1v1 with your friend can also help in those late game situations when you are just battling the final person in your lobby.</p>
      <h3>Tip 2. Play More Solo Matches</h3>
      <p>Playing solo matches may not be the most fun way to play, but it is definitely the most efficient way to improve your skills at a high rate. Challenge yourself by limiting yourself to certain weapons or building at certain stages of the game.</p>
      <p>This could help you when you are in tight situations when you only have limited resources, or in the beginning of the game when you don’t have good weapons.
      </p>
      <h3>Tip 3. Position Yourself Well</h3>
      <p>Positioning is one of the most important things to win a game in Fortnite. If you are out of the safe zone during late game, it is very likely that someone will spot you and put you in a tough position.</p>
      <p>Try to find a mountain and build up on it. You will get a good view over the safe zone and will probably find an enemy to rain down upon.</p>
      <p>If there aren’t any mountains near by, try building a 1x1 fort. Don’t make it too high though because if you get shot down, you will lose some valuable health.</p>
      <h3>Tip 4. Remember to Hold Healing Items</h3>
      <p>Having heals may determine whether or not you will survive a fight. You should always have any type of healing item on you that you can use quickly to get that edge on your opponent.</p>
      <p>Even if you see a nice weapon that you want to pick up, do not go on in a game without holding a healing item.</p>
      <h3>Tip 5. Finish Knocked Players</h3>
      <p>With a recent update, you gain health and shield when you kill a knocked enemy. Although this is very unpopular within the community, finishing a knocked enemy can be the perfect thing to do.</p>
      <p>With this in mind, remember that other players may also finish your knocked teammate, so if you can be sure to assist your fellow teammate.</p>
      <h3>Tip 6. Practice Editing</h3>
      <p>With building evolving at a rapid rate, and a decrease in the maximum amount of materials available, editing has become very important in modern day fortnite.</p>
      <p>Pulling off quick edits can give you the ace up your sleeve that your enemy wasn’t prepared for. Do editing tests to evaluate where your current skill level is at and use that information to improve certain aspects of your editing.</p>
      <h3>Tip 7. Know When to Retreat</h3>
      <p>A key to winning games is knowing when to retreat. If you play too aggressive, it will lead to your inevitable death.</p>
      <p>If you are low on health and know that your opponent has a much better chance of winning the fight, just leave. Especially when the storm is coming in. You must always be aware of the storm when fighting, and if you think it will overwhelm you, just leave by using a launch pad for example.</p>
      <h3>Tip 8. Find Your Playstyle</h3>
      <p>Finding your playstyle is a key way to adjust your practicing to a way that will be most effective for you. Everyone is different, so just because your favorite streamer/youtuber can get 20 kills a game, doesn’t mean that you should go in guns blazing.</p>
      <p>If you are more comfortable staying back and letting the fights happen while thinking out your next move, then you know you are a more cautious player and you probably want to work on your planning skills.</p>
      <p>If you like to run towards bullets instead of away and love to go build to the sky, then you know you are an aggressive player. Work on your close quarter gun fights, and be sure to stay aware of your surroundings, and the safe circle.</p>
      <h3>Tip 9. Watch Streamers/ESports Games</h3>
      <p>The best of the best are always finding the new and upcoming strategies. You could be left behind in the dust if you don’t keep up with the new meta strategy.</p>
      <p>This doesn’t mean that you should be spending more time watching streams then playing the game. You can never get better at a game if you don’t play it.</p>
      <h3>Tip 10. Land at Hotspots</h3>
      <p>Landing at hotspots like Tilted Towers or Retail Row is one of the best ways to improve your early game.</p>
      <p>When you land at a place with a lot of people, you are forced to play more rushed and with worse weapons. You also are exposed to more shotgun and smg fights.</p>
      <p>This will help you tremendously as the early game is usually the most triggering part of the game. Building a tolerance for dying quickly will help you play more games without getting mad or bored as quickly.</p>
      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>That is all for the 10 fortnite tips that will help you win more games. If you follow these tips you will be sending more people to that lobby and watching your wins pile up as well as your bragging rights.
